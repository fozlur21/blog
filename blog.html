            Question-1: What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?
        </h5>

            What is DOM:
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-900 px-10">
            The Document Object Model (DOM), a programming interface,
            represents the hierarchy of
            an HTML document's components as a tree-like hierarchical structure. It enables programmers to use
            scripting
            languages like JavaScript to dynamically change the information, structure, and style of a web page.
        </p>

            The purpose of DOM:
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-900 px-10">
            The DOM is designed to give programmes and scripts a platform- and language-neutral means of accessing
            and
            updating the content and structure of web pages. Being a tree of nodes and objects that can be accessed
            and
            modified using a standardised set of methods and properties, the DOM offers a standard way to describe
            HTML.

        <h5 class="text-xl text-emerald-700">Question-3:What is event bubble?</h5>
        <p class="text-lime-700 mt-2">
            Event bubble:
        <p class="px-10 mb-4">
            When an event is triggered on a child element, it will propagate upward through its parent elements,
            activating their corresponding event handlers as well. This process is known as event bubbling. If not
            regulated, it can have unwanted repercussions. It can be handy for processing events on parent components
            that contain numerous child elements with the same event handler.

        <h5 class="text-xl text-emerald-700">Question-4: What is a call back function and why will you use it?</h5>
        <p class="text-lime-700 mt-2">
            call back function:
        </p>
        <p class="px-10 mb-4">
            A callback function is one that receives another function as an input and is designed to be called after the
            first function has finished its job. A callback function's main function is to enable the calling function
            to carry out some logic after the called function has finished its job.

            I will use it because:
        </p>
        <p class="px-10 mb-4">
            Callback functions are frequently used in asynchronous programming, event handling, and generalisation to
            provide a means for a function to transfer the execution of certain logic to another function.
